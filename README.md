# CitiBike_Tableau

This repository contains the cleaning notebook for the Tableau assignment of the Rice Universityt Data Analysis and Visualization Boot Camp.

You can visit the Tableau Public Story [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/luis.ruiz.lopez#!/vizhome/CitiBike-LFRuiz/CityBike-2021?publish=yes)

 
In the notebook I've cleaned the data from [CitiBike webpage](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) using pandas, and selected a random sample using random and sample. 


In the Tableau Public Story you can see my analysis about the use of the system for maintanance of the system porpuses and the users of the system for marketing porpuses.
